## Objective
Set up a Windows 11 virtual machine in VirtualBox as the first step for SOC and Help Desk practice labs.

## Steps Completed Today
1. Created a new VirtualBox VM:
   - Name: Win11-Endpoint
   - OS Type: Microsoft Windows
   - OS Version: Windows 11 (64-bit)
   - Allocated RAM: 4 GB
   - Virtual Hard Disk: VDI, 50 GB, dynamically allocated
   - Attached ISO: Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for installation
2. Configured VM settings:
   - Checked storage controller (SATA)
   - Attached ISO to optical drive
3. Booted the VM from the ISO:
   - Reached Windows 11 installer screen
   - Verified that the VM is running correctly
4. Took screenshots of:
   - VM creation screen (Win11-VM-Creation.png)
   - Booting from ISO (Win11-VM-BootFromISO.png)

## Notes
- This lab will serve as the foundation for future exercises, including Active Directory setup, security testing, and SOC simulations.
- Today’s progress documents only the initial VM creation and boot verification.
